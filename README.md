## Parkinson’s Disease Detection Using Machine Learning   

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to detect Parkinson's Disease (PD) early and accurately using clinical and biometric data. The system utilizes advanced ML models to analyze patterns in voice recordings, hand tremor data, or other motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s.  

Key features include:  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Processes diverse datasets, such as voice frequency variations, movement irregularities, or handwriting analysis, to identify subtle biomarkers of Parkinson’s.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employs supervised learning techniques, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models (e.g., neural networks), for classification and prediction.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features like amplitude, frequency, jitter, and tremor patterns to enhance model performance.  
- **User-Friendly Deployment**: Integrates the detection system with an interactive interface for easy input of patient data and instant feedback.  

This system is designed to aid medical professionals in early diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease, improving patient outcomes through timely intervention. Its real-world applications include clinical screening, telemedicine, and personalized healthcare.
